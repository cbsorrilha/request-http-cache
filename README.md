# request-http-cache

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gitterHQ/request-http-cache.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gitterHQ/request-http-cache) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/gitterHQ/request-http-cache/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/gitterHQ/request-http-cache)

A request "middleware" for caching HTTP responses in-memory or in Redis. Specifically built for
Gitter's communications with GitHub.

```
npm install request-http-cache
```

## About

This module is intended for use with [request-extensible](https://github.com/suprememoocow/request-extensible).

It is designed to honor the HTTP caching semantics used by the GitHub API and use
Conditional Requests, using ETags, for stale responses.

Currently, it has been specifically designed for caching GitHub API responses.
It makes some assumptions about access tokens and `Vary` headers which may result
in incorrect results for other APIs, altough this is not necessarily the case.

In future, ideally this module would adhere to the HTTP specification and be
useable for any API.

## Using

### Using with an in-memory Backend

```javascript
var requestExt = require('request-extensible');
var RequestHttpCache = require('request-http-cache');

var httpRequestCache = new RequestHttpCache({
  max: 1024*1024 // Maximum cache size (1mb) defaults to 512Kb
});

var request = requestExt({
  extensions: [
    httpRequestCache.extension
  ]
});

// Now use request as you would request/request
request({ url: 'https://api.github.com/users/suprememoocow' }, function(err, response, body) {

});
```

### Using with a Redis Backend

When using with a Redis backend, it's highly recommended to use `maxmemory` and
`maxmemory-policy` configurations to ensure that the Redis memory usage doesn't
grow out of control.

```javascript
var requestExt = require('request-extensible');
var RequestHttpCache = require('request-http-cache');

var httpRequestCache = new RequestHttpCache({
  backend: 'redis',
  redis: {
    host: "localhost",
    port: 6379
  },
  redisClient: redisClient, // Or you can pass in your Redis client
  ttl: 86400                // Maximum cached response time
});

var request = requestExt({
  extensions: [
    httpRequestCache.extension
  ]
});

// Now use request as you would request/request
request({ url: 'https://api.github.com/users/suprememoocow' }, function(err, response, body) {

});

```
